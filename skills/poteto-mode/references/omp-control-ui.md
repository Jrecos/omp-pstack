description: Packaged OMP adaptation of cursor-team-kit's control-ui skill. Build or adapt a local browser/CDP harness to drive and inspect a web, IDE, or Electron UI. Use for local UI verification, screenshots, accessibility snapshots, perf profiles, visual diffs, or reproducing UI bugs.

# Control UI

> Adapted from `cursor-team-kit/skills/control-ui/SKILL.md` at `cursor/plugins` commit `93b00b89ef425a9c1bac0d0b317dfc49c930ac99` (source SHA-1 `334b2ca415e3848729aad8c2bb8609875a9459b2`). Cursor-specific tool references are translated to native OMP mechanics; the harness patterns and guardrails are preserved.

Use local browser automation to verify UI behavior with evidence. First reuse the repo's own Playwright, browser, or Electron harness if it exists; otherwise assemble a temporary local harness around the app's dev server or Chromium debug port.

## What It Is Used For

- Reproducing UI bugs that depend on real browser focus, keyboard input, scrolling, resizing, or rendering.
- Verifying visual or accessibility changes with screenshots and snapshots.
- Checking local web, IDE, or Electron behavior before shipping.
- Capturing console logs, network logs, CPU profiles, traces, or heap snapshots.
- Creating before/after evidence for verification claims.

## Setup Pattern

1. Start the app locally using the repo's documented dev command.
2. Discover existing local harnesses: Playwright tests, Cypress specs, Storybook, browser scripts, Electron launch scripts, or snapshot tools.
3. For a web app, connect to the local URL with the existing browser tooling.
4. For Electron/Chromium, enable a remote debugging port when supported.
5. Select the correct page by stable app markers, not by tab order alone.
6. Prefer accessibility roles, labels, and stable `data-*` selectors over coordinates.

## Native OMP Browser Tool

In an OMP session the built-in browser is the first-class harness: `browser.open` a named tab, drive it with the direct helpers (`observe`, `click`, `type`, `fill`, `press`, `scroll`, `select`, `screenshot`, `extract`), and run custom JavaScript through `tab.run`. It launches real Chromium, so screenshots and ARIA snapshots are genuine evidence.

- `tab.observe()` maps interactive elements to stable ids; act on `tab.id(...)` handles rather than CSS guessing.
- `tab.ariaSnapshot()` is the accessibility-snapshot evidence.
- `tab.run(code)` executes arbitrary JavaScript in the page for probes the helpers do not cover.
- Close tabs you opened with `browser.close` when done.

Prefer the native browser over a bespoke Playwright script for a single probe. Reach for a checked-in Playwright/Cypress harness or raw CDP when the repo's own suite, a persistent multi-page flow, or a profile capture needs it.

## Generic Web Harness

Use the repo's installed browser tooling when possible. If the repo already has Playwright, a minimal one-off probe looks like:

```javascript
import { chromium } from "playwright";

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage({ viewport: { width: 1280, height: 800 } });
await page.goto("http://127.0.0.1:<port>");
await page.getByRole("button", { name: /submit/i }).click();
await page.screenshot({ path: "/tmp/ui-harness-after.png", fullPage: true });
await browser.close();
```

Do not add Playwright as a project dependency just for this probe unless the user asks. Prefer existing dev dependencies, the native OMP browser, or external browser tools already available in the environment.

## Generic CDP Harness

For Electron or a Chromium app launched with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>`, connect over CDP. The native OMP browser can attach to an existing CDP endpoint (`app.cdp_url`); a Playwright script attaching directly looks like:

```javascript
import { chromium } from "playwright";

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP("http://127.0.0.1:<debug-port>");
const pages = browser.contexts().flatMap((context) => context.pages());
let page;
for (const candidate of pages) {
  if (await candidate.locator("<app-root-selector>").count()) {
    page = candidate;
    break;
  }
}

if (!page) {
  console.log(await Promise.all(pages.map(async (p) => ({
    title: await p.title(),
    url: p.url(),
  }))));
  throw new Error("No matching app page found");
}

await page.screenshot({ path: "/tmp/ui-harness-cdp.png", fullPage: true });
await browser.close();
```

Replace `<app-root-selector>` with a stable marker from the current repo, such as a root app node, landmark, or product-specific `data-*` attribute.

## Interaction Loop

1. Capture a page snapshot or screenshot before acting.
2. Choose a target from the latest page structure.
3. Perform exactly one structural action: click, type, keypress, drag, scroll, navigate, or resize.
4. Capture a fresh snapshot/screenshot.
5. Verify the expected state change.
6. Save artifacts for before/after comparisons when the user asked for proof.

## CDP Capabilities

Use raw CDP only when higher-level browser APIs are insufficient:

- Performance: CPU profiles, traces, paint flashing, FPS meter, layout shift inspection.
- Memory: heap snapshots and forced GC for leak investigations.
- Network: request blocking, throttling, cache disablement, request/response logs.
- Rendering: viewport changes, color scheme emulation, reduced motion, accessibility checks.
- Debugging: console streaming, exception capture, DOM snapshots.

## Page Selection

When multiple app windows/tabs share a debug port:

- Prefer a positive marker for the surface under test, such as an app root selector.
- Use a negative marker to avoid the wrong surface when necessary.
- If no page matches, list available page titles and URLs instead of guessing.

## Guardrails

- Do not rely on stale element references after navigation or structural changes.
- Avoid coordinate clicks unless a fresh screenshot was captured immediately before the click.
- Keep test data local and disposable.
- Do not store screenshots or heap snapshots from privacy-sensitive workspaces unless the user explicitly agrees.
- Do not hard-code selectors, ports, or script paths from another repository. Discover the current repo's local app markers.
- Clean up dev servers, debug sessions, and temp profiles when done. Close OMP browser tabs you opened; never close tabs the user owns.
